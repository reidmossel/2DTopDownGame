This is a 2D Top Down Shooter Game project I started working on 9/7/2023 (I think?).
Using Unity Editor version 2022.3.9f1.

current verision: 0.02 "The MVP"

Plans for v0.03 "Sounds like Saving":

- Add a Save system for saving Highscores
- Add some temp sounds and (maybe) some music

Plans for the future:

- Add upgrades for the player (different weapon types, healing, armor)
- Add upgrades for the enemies (defferent types of enemies, weapons)
- Art Overhaul

Possibly but no promises:

- Different "battlegrounds"
- Online Leaderboard for Highscores
- Dictionary for the different enemy types you discover
- Different game modes: Tower Defense / Top Down Shooter
